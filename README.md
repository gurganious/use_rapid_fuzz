### Output

```
Row 0 ---> Data I tried to switch from windows to macOs a couple years ago and here is the pros and cons:\nPros: -Much easier -more comfortable -battery life -much safer -The battery will stop charging after the battery percentage reach 100 and then the laptop will start take the power from the power adapter instead of taking from the battery (the most feature i like) -much faster -MBA has no fan -there no that high temperature -if you have iPhone you will be able to use airdrop and the other apples features\nThe cons: -not all apps you can find it on macOS so you will suffer especially if you used to download allot of apps, and especially after adding the M1 -the brightness i find it a little bit low -the 2 usb-c and the Aux ports that only what it has so you need to buy a type-c hub\nAnd thats it
Row 1 ---> Data My MacBook Air 2020 (still under warranty) is not detecting the charger while the USB C ports can detect other devices like external hard disk or iPhone.
Row 2 ---> Data Itâ€™s not the port or the charger. It looks like this is a motherboard issue as the USB ports can no longer be used to display or charge the computer. The computer has failed after about three years in service. I just bought a Mac, but thanks for your considered reply.
Row 3 ---> Data Nothing to add, just that this is happening to me with two different monitors. Super frustrating, but I guess I'll have to settle for HDMI for now
